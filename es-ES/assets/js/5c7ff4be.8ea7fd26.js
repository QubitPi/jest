You can create a mock function with jest.fn(). If no implementation is given, the mock function will return undefined when invoked.","sidebar":"api"},"mock-functions":{"id":"mock-functions","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.","sidebar":"docs"},"mongodb":{"id":"mongodb","title":"Using with MongoDB","description":"With the Global Setup/Teardown and Async Test Environment APIs, Jest can work smoothly with MongoDB.","sidebar":"docs"},"more-resources":{"id":"more-resources","title":"More Resources","description":"By now you should have a good idea of how Jest can help you test your applications.
